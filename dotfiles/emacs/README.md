Made using spacemacs, a community-driven Emacs destribution. 
Simple and easy to install, and god-tier documentation and usability
(something rare for Emacs on my experience).
Simply install Spacemacs from the link: https://www.spacemacs.org/, 
open it one time and let it update itself, and on your home dir, find 
the .spacemacs file and put this one.
