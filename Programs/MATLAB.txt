--------To install matlab on Arch (and i believe in any system): -----------

First, download matlab zip in https://www.mathworks.com/login?uri=%2Fdownloads%2Fweb_downloads

After this, go to the local that was downloaded, and if needed, move to another place.

In the local that you choose (~/MATLAB, by example), extract with $ unzip **nameofzipmatlab.zip**

After extracting, go to the bin paste created by the extracted files(~/MATLAB/bin, in the example)

Run install with $ sh install.sh

After installing, go back to the bin, and run a file called activate_matlab.sh, with $ sh activate_matlab.sh

With this, you can run matlab with the path of the installed matlab ($ ~/MATLAB/matlab, in the example). 

The place that the command is runned, is the workspace that MATLAB will understand.
