To save a file, the emacs command will make too.

But to save a file in evil, use :qwa <enter>

To quit without saving, do :qa! <enter>

This is a vim instance, created by evil package. To learn how to navigate and use VIM things, go to M-x evil-tutor-start

THe following are from here:

To navigate the cursor: mouse, setinhas or hjkl

To navigate the buffers that are open, you can go to the bottom left, on the name of the file, and left click (previous buffer) or right click (next buffer)

While in normal state, you can delete caracters in the cursor by pressing x.

To write, press "I". You will go to "insert mode".

To delete words, in the normal state, press dw as the cursor is in the início of the word.

To delete the end of a line, from a referee, just go to the referee, and press d$.

To delete the line, dd.


"u" to undo the last command.(spoiler: writing is a command.)

To redo a command, C-r.

To put the last thing that is in dd(last delection), you just put in back, with "p". In normal state.

To replace a caracter, while in normal mode, press r, and after this press the key that will replace it.

You can change the rest of a word, or a word, by pressing, in normal mode, cw in the caracter that initiates the error. It also puts you in the insert mode.

To navigate on the doc, you can press G to go to the bottom of the doc. To go to the top, press gg. To go to a line, press : and the line of the page.


To search in the text, press "/" and the word or phrase. To go to the next answer, press n. To go backwards, press N. To search starting by the bottom to the top, press ? instead of /. 

To see the matching parenthesis, press % on one of the pairs.

To replace a word, use :s/"word"/"new-word". This will change just the first word. To change all the words on one line, use :s/"word"/"new-word/g". To change all the words between two lines, put :"n°line-início","n°-line-fim"/"word"/"new
word/g". To change all the words on the buffer, use :%s/"word"/"new-word"/g.

To execute a external command (a shell one, by example), use :! -command-.

To paste, use shift+insert. 

to navigate files, go to SPC f f


#####TO USE LATEX IN SPACEMACS#######

On terminal:
$ sudo pacman -S texlive-most texlive-lang texlive-bibtexextra texlive-fontsextra biber evince


Go to the dot spacemacs file, and do the installation following : https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/latex/README.html.

While configuring the latex, add :variables latex-enable-magic t, to enable the 
funny leters (Omega, by example). To use the funny letters, just put them inside a math variable ($$)

Now, in the neutral mode, do SPC m a. Should open the file.
